Targeting Index Keys
We save all targeting info into redis through the hset,
you can use smembers(key) method to get all campaign ids.
The key = prefix + targeting item id.
Geographic
key=geo_${city_id}
the geo_country and geo_region targeting infos are converted to geocity data,
so you just get the geo index through geo${city_id}.
OS Families
key=os_ ver_${os_family_version_id}
the os_families targeting info are converted to os_family_versions data,
so you also just get the index through osver${os_family_version_id}.
Device Models
key= dev_ m_${device_model_id}
the device_vendors targeting info are converted to device_models data,
so you also just get the index through devm${device_model_id}.
Languages
key=lang_${language_id}
Carriers
key=carrier_${carrier_id}
Connection Types
key=conn_ t_${connection_type_id}
Day Part
